# Complete Intro to SQLite (Day 2)

Course website: <https://sqlite.holt.courses/>

[sqlpkg](https://sqlpkg.org/) is the website for SQLite extensions.

`->` returns JSON (if you want to do more operators) and `->>` returns SQL type:

```sql
SELECT json('{"username": "btholt", "name": { "first": "Brian" }, "favorites":["Daft Punk", "Radiohead"]}') -> 'name' ->> 'first';
```

Really should always use JSONB: it's compact & compressed. Less readable at rest
but alas.

```sql
SELECT data -> 'name' ->> 'first' AS first, data -> 'name' ->> 'last' as last FROM users;
```

[Litestream](https://litestream.io/) is pretty slick.

[litefs](https://github.com/superfly/litefs) by Fly.io is a way to replicate
SQLite via FUSE.

[libSQL](https://turso.tech/libsql) is a fork of SQLite by Turso. It's meant to
be a "modern" take since SQLite isn't open for general contributions. It changes
the paradigm to a more standard server (versus library for writing to a file)
and is API based.

Hurray for API client interop i.e. [Postman-compat collection](https://sqlite.holt.courses/sqld-collection.json)
& importing into Bruno.

[Local-first](https://localfirstweb.dev/) is a relatively new idea of keeping
data local to the host, for speed, and async-ing it to a persisted data store
behind the scenes.

A traditional architecture:

Versus local-first w/ async-ing:

If you skip the _sync_ part, then it would just be done via manual import/export
which is totally legit, but might not be the UX that you're after.

(Thanks Brian&mdash;he referenced these on a talk last night at JSMN.)

Using libsql, the code changes are surprisingly minimal:

```sh
sqld --grpc-listen-addr=127.0.0.1:5001
```

```js
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const db = createClient({
  url: "file:local-data.db",
  syncUrl: "http://localhost:5001",
  syncPeriod: 60,
});

const rep = await db.sync();
```
