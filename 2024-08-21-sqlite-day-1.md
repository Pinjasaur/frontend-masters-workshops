# Complete Intro to SQLite (Day 1)

Course website: <https://sqlite.holt.courses/>

It's _actually_ pronounced "ess-cue-lite". TIL.

History:

- Created for the US Navy in 2000 by Dr. Hipp
- It's _now_ open source (public domain), but _not_ open to general contribs
- Uses Fossil, not Git (akin to Torvalds building Git for Linux kernel dev)
  - [Fossil vs Git](https://www.fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki#devorg)

[pgloader](https://pgloader.io/) for migrating SQLite -> Postgres (and others).

[Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) is a repo sample databases.

`.help` to see all the dot-commands.

[Complete Intro to SQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql/) is a good
reference, even though it's Postgres. The raw syntax is mostly the same.

TIL it's generally case-insensitive, even on tables & columns.

More better pagination instead of `LIMIT x OFFSET y`, still do a `LIMIT` but
reference the last entity ID and do a `>=`. In the event of data changing or
being inserted, this keeps it consistent and is slightly more robust.

Protip: `RETURNING` grammar for selecting the rows updated to see what changed.

Used like:

```sql
UPDATE Artist SET name = 'Justice' WHERE name = 'Daft Punk' RETURNING *;
```

There's only four primitive data types: `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT`, and `BLOB`.
Plus `NULL`, of course. There's keywords, shortcuts, and aliases, but ultimately
it's one of these core types. [More details](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html).

It's impressive how _permissive_ SQLite is: it'll let you add a column without
giving it a name. And then you have a column you can't really do anything with.

Table aliases always kinda throw me off because you generally define the aliases
_after_ where they're used in the statement.

`JOIN` == `INNER JOIN`.

Nice Wikipedia diagram:

![SQL Joins](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/SQL_Joins.svg)

Left == `FROM` table, Right == `JOIN` table.

SQLite, by default, does _not_ respect foreign keys.

_Each time_ you open the database, you _must_ use a pragma:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys=on;
```

Protip: `HAVING` let's you filter on the _aggregated_ result set e.g.

```sql
...
HAVING
    COUNT(Track.GenreId) > 300;
```

There's _no_ date _or_ boolean types. Particularly problematic for dates.

Protip: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`.

Or, shorthand in the CLI: `.eqp on`.

Look for `--SCAN` which is the tell-tale that it's looking at _every_ row in the
table. Using indexes, you can get this to be replaced with `--SEARCH` which is
faster because it's not _scanning_ every row.

Tables that are mostly written to, be cautious with indexing. It will reduce
perf because the database has to modify tables _and_ indexes.

Cool that SQLite supports full-text search natively.
